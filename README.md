# The Evil Button

This is a fun, interactive web page I created for my **CMSC 13: Surveys of Programming Paradigms class activity**. The page features a button that reacts to user actions using **JavaScript event listeners**, giving playful warnings and responses.

Created specifically for **Lab Work 4. An exercise with Listeners**. No external libraries are required.
